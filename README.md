## üìå About

**Pipex** is a 42 project that replicates shell behavior using UNIX system calls. It focuses on executing two or more commands with input/output redirection and piping, similar to how the shell processes commands like:


üõ†Ô∏è Build
make # builds mandatory version
make bonus # builds bonus version (multi-pipe & here_doc support)

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage Example
Mandatory Version
./pipex file1 "cat" "wc -l" file2

Bonus Version (Multiple Commands)
./pipex file1 "grep a" "sort" "uniq" file2

Bonus Version (here_doc)
./pipex here_doc END "cat" "wc -c" file2
